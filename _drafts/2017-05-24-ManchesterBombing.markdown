Manchester Concert Bomb

I thought long and hard about the threat of Terrorist attacks, I grew up with the IRA bombing campaign's. Did we change our way of life for them, I don't think so? 

My challenge to you is:-
1. Do you know first aid?
2. Do you know the differences with mass causalities?
3. Do you carry a First Aid Kit?

In an Urban mass causality situation the **Golden Hour** is very important, how quickly you can stabilise the ones that need direct medical care makes an enormous difference to their long term health. But some injuries can be left a little while longer, and others are unfortunately beyond help.  If you don't have medical knowledge you should not be making those decisions. But if you are the only sensible one on the ground, then you need to check on as many victims as possible, determine what you can do to help. 

You need to keep your cool, and get others to help you. **But first** you need to make yourself safe, determine if there may be secondary bombs or bombers in the area.
