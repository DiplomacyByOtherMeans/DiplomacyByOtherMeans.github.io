Who seats in the priority seats on the Underground? 

## Priority Seats 

I came late to travelling to work on the London Underground. I spent many years being able to walk to work. I only mention this so you the reader can factor into your view on this post. 
So my normal journey into work is on the Northern Line, and as I start only one stop before the end, I am pretty much guaranteed a seat. I tend to use the first carriage as changing at Bank with the DLR entrances adds a lot to the inter change with the herd blocking the platform (They appear to have forgotten how to queue, and also walking on the left!). So we all have a preferred seat right, creatures of habit that's us. So I started to notice the people that made a bee line for the priority seats... why would you do this, when you are not physically disabled when there are other seats available? So I started to note who took these seats with no obvious disabilities and the interesting think is that it is mostly young white woman. With the next biggest group being Asian men. I only note details if there are other seats available, if its the last seat available then fair game? 
So why is this, why seat on a seat that has less space, you have a screen that reduces the space available on one side. What's the logic for this? I don't get it.
