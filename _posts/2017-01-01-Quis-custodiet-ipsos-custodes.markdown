## Wilson Doctrine

This was the  agreement between MPs and the security services caused by claims that the security services had been spying on labour MPs and briefing against them. 
This is normally called planning to overthrowing an elected government, and is normally described as treason. 

The Investigatory Powers Tribunal ruled that the doctrine in fact had no legal standing. 

Which means that the security services could have been monitoring MPs all along. 

So my point is that the people that are shouting we should trust them have been caught out breaking their oaths. So why would we believe that they can be trusted with even more data!

I wait to be convinced that they have presented any  evidence that they can now be trusted.
