Security Professionals and being paranoid. 


So where to start, well i noticed that someone i know has changed jobs and moved to a security consultancy that i had not seen before. It appeared to be a new company and I checked companies house (as you do) for background information. This lead me to the fact that someone else i knew was a directoy of the company, who had used his personal address as a correspondence one. I knew this as a fact because when I checked google earth his house was the only one blurred out. Which made me think if you want to hide in plain site dont ask google to remove your house from the map. So his paranoia makes him stand out, and what have you gained, that your house but not the surrounding area is blurred. What do you gain from his, an adversary is not going to think damn do i need a type 57 lock pick or a type 20. He is going to carry them all, and he not be surprise because you have a moat, because that bit will be on the google earth picture. 

So my point is if you want to be off grid you have to think about the small thinks first, and have a plan. Now the record will be on companies house for a long time, and i bet a conversation with google earth to unhide your house will go well....
